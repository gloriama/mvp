GOALS:

[x] create goal:
  name of goal
  frequency: number of times per (day/)week(/month) you want to do it
  points earned per time
  (how many times do you do it in a row until you get a free pass?)

[ ] view goals:
  x total points at the top
  table view of goals including:
    x definition of goal (name freq points)
    some form of how you're doing in each of them (points earned, maybe a graph of consistency)
    x a place to indicate that you did it
      (limit amount of times you are allowed to do a thing in a week)
      (must somehow show the current week separately from previous data)

[x] update goal:
  can edit. will not retroactively change points earned etc.
  (make it update not by name but by mongoose id)

[x] delete goal:
  obvious. will not retroactively change points earned etc.
  (make it delete not by name but by mongoose id)

REWARDS:
[x] simplest will be that 1 point = 1 cent toward buying whatever you want to buy
  
(REWARDS:

create reward:
  name: e.g. "Eat an In-N-Out burger" "Buy"
  points needed for reward
)
